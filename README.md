pact: Partition And Count on Theories
===============================================================================

pact is a hashing based projected approximate model counter for SMT theories, based on cvc5.

This version of the pact is designed to serve as a supplementary tool for a paper currently undergoing peer review. Please refer to [cvc5's readme](README-cvc5.md) for more details about cvc5.

## Build for Counting

```
./configure.sh --auto-download
cd build
make
```

## Use for Counting

Count by enumeration.

`./cvc5 -e <filename>`

Count as pact.

`./cvc5 -S <filename>`

Count with varying epsilon and delta

`./cvc5 -S --delta <value> --epsilon <value> <filename>`

Count with varying starting slicesize

`./cvc5 -S --slicesize <value> <filename>`

Issue `./cvc5 -h` and look for `Model Counting Module` for more options.

Build and Dependencies
